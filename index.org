*** Welcome

------

Hi! I'm Thomas, a french software engineer.

I did a lot of Python, and broke a few databases. I helped me to understand why did they break... at least, most of the time.

I like to solve problems involving computers.

*** Tradelab (Nov 2018)

- I was hired as a DevOps/ Database expert

*** 1000Mercis/Numberly Group (Jan 2016 - Oct 2018)

- I was hired as a Python developer
- Joined a small team (2-5) 
- Python and security best practices
- SQL (SQL-Server)

This experience was very interesting on various subjects. 
At Numberly, I've discovered how it feels to work with various (also non technical) profiles, and surprisingly, I've enjoyed it a lot.

Initially hired as a Python Developer, I've worked on several topics. 
So far, my favourite one was about optimizing legacy Python code heavily used in production. 
After a few but anxiety-prone race-condition bugs, we managed to divide the load of a whole cluster by 3, and we were pretty happy about it - the patch contained less than 200 lines of code.

Then, I've increased my perimeter and also had opportunities to help with production system's reliability and information/infrastructure security.

*** OVH (May-Oct 2015)

#+ATTR_HTML: :style float:right
[[file:images/ovh.png]]

- It was my last internship
- I was mostly in Perl/Python
- I also used AngularJS
- Everything was running on Linux


At OVH, I've learned what's a "pretty big" infrastructure and what it involves to keep it up and running.
Also, handling a lot of services, including legacy ones, at scale is hard - handling software lifecycle is clearly a big challenge.

** Interests


I enjoy programming a lot. 
I have professional experiences with Python (2.7+) and still prefer Python for various personal projects.
The same applies for shell scripting on Linux, but I'm not enjoying that as much as Python :)

I also use `Ansible`, have a daily use of `Git` and Linux. 
I find my accidental and limited knowledge of Linux very useful in a professional context involving Linux boxes.

On a more personal touch, I use `emacs` and had plenty of jokes about it.
I enjoy programming in `Rust` in my spare time, and stupid and/or useless projects. See my github for /non pertinent stuff/.


I also like bonsa√Øs, internet culture, video-games and hacking.
