<p>I think humain beings, are just a very complicated form of bacteria.</p>
<p>If look at the earth as a living organism [...] it's certainly an host for life,
and we are considered as living organism but really, we're host for life </p>
<p>There is more e.-coli living inside our gut than they've ever been people ever!
There's bacteria that's constantly around you and your body body is fighting that bacteria</p>
<p>Until your body grows old and dies. Then it does not fight anymore and that bacteria just eat your body
That what it does - I mean, that why it's there for.</p>
<p>Okay well,</p>
<p>If you look at the earth, as this living organism, and like you were flying into LA
And you're passing over these beautiful mountains, and you see the ocean ahead, it all looks 
natural and beautiful</p>
<p>But then you see LA - W... What the fuck is that? 
That a growth - that's a cancer, it's big, it's brown and it stinks, and smoke comes out of there</p>
<p>And it's get bigger every year. And doesn't matter what you do, it's gonna keep going</p>
<p>You could knock it down with a fucking hurricane: it rebuilds</p>
<p>Light it on fire: it rebuilds</p>
<p>And I think if you were an intelligent life-form from another planet and you were looking at the earth, you wouldn't see individual people,
you wouldn't see housekeepers, limo drivers and stand-up comedians - you wouldn't see that. </p>
<p>You would see mold on a sandwich. I think if you look at us objectively, and the way we're headed and the way we've always been, it does not matter
how access to information we have, nor matter technological innvovation we have, we always gonna destroy the earth, because I think somehow or another 
that's what we're supposed to do. </p>
<p>I think that's our purpose here on earth, 
I think we are here to fuck shit up
I think we're here to eat the sandwich.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well why is it (Los Angeles) getting bigger?
Why do people just keep fucking having kids constantly?
What is this all about?</p>
<p>Well, I think, that it's our purpose, much like how yeast makes bread rise or mold takes over a fucking sandwich.</p>
<p>I think we're just a very complicated form of bacteria - 
and all our thoughts on ourselves, it's all just biological tricks to keep your ego alive, to keep your biology alive.</p>
<p>To make sure you keep perpetuating this fucking thing.</p>
<p>To make this human organism, this one gigantic organism keep growing.</p>
<p>If you look at like mold on a sandwich, you don't look at individual mold spores with individual identities and jobs and careers, you look at a pile of fucking mold.
And that's what people are man, we just think we're individuals.</p>
<p>We're not, we're one collective group.
And this whole complex system of social order and all this shit, might just be ways to effectively move along the breeding process.</p>
