        <h1>Context</h1>
<p>I work in the advertising field. Months ago, I heard about DNS Cookies but did not believe that one can actually track people using it.
I was wrong</p>
<p>So we had that website, <a href="http://www.dnscookie.com/">dnscookie.com</a> hitting the top on hackernews.</p>
<p>Eventually, in the advertising field, a lot of people asked themselves about it. 
dnscookie.com explains basically how we can track users using DNS Cookies, but (IMHO) is not very precise.</p>
<p>I decided to take a look on my spare time and publish everything I learnt.</p>
<p>In my own point of view, explaining this method to "everyone" is a way to prevent abuses from avertising companies.</p>
<hr>
<p>I'll use the term "DNS tracking" instead of DNS Cookie, to avoid confusion with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7873">RFC 7873</a></p>
<h1>General Explanation</h1>
<p>There is two important things involved in order to track users using DNS.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7873">RFC 7873</a>: DNS Cookies. It allows "grouping" DNS Queries and answers per clients, at server side, by doing, eg, log UDP network analysis.</li>
<li>HTTP has to be used at some point. Individual HTTP Queries have to be correlated with DNS activity, especially when <em>the DNS cache is hit</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The general method can be explained in 4 steps, with 4 prerequesites.</p>
<ul>
<li>You own and control the authoritative DNS Server involved</li>
<li>Same for HTTP Servers</li>
<li>You have to hack both to emit various events in real time, ie, DNS resolutions and HTTP GET queries</li>
<li>You have to be able to correlate events emited by those below, in <em>pseudo-realtime</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>(1)</strong>: Force a client to perform DNS resolutions on various subdomains subsequently followed by HTTP queries.<br>
  This is achieved by including <em>statics</em> within a webpage, like images or even fonts (using CSS for tracking? Who cares).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(2)</strong>: Extract DNS resolutions performed by a single client (identifiable using the DNS Cookie) in step (1).<br>
  Those could be missing if the client is already known (== DNS answer still in client's cache).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(3)</strong>: HTTP requests are fired by the browser to fetch statics, on domains previously resolved in (1) or stored in DNS cache.<br>
  Considering 2 backend HTTP Servers and 32 HTTP queries distributed (randomly) on both, this creates or recreates<br>
<em>a 32 bits identifier</em>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(4)</strong>: as every resouce queried in HTTP is uniquely identifiable, correlating batches of 32 queries on multiple backend servers allow us to 
  forge a somewhat reliable identifier.<br>
  If the client is already known, the step (1) and (2) are skipped, because DNS answers are still in the client's cache, 
  and the distribution on backends HTTP server will be the same. Leading to the same identifier.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's somewhat important to avoid any browser-based caching at step (3). 
This is prevented by using unique URLs, as the initial index.html (or whatever includes our 32 statics inclusion) is generated on-the-fly for each HTTP query.</p>
<h1>Sequence Diagram</h1>
<p>example.com has IP <em>10.10.0.1</em></p>
<p>Two IP are used to determine/forge an identifier, <em>10.10.1.1</em> and <em>10.10.1.2</em></p>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/dns_cookie_tracking.png"></p>
<h1>Efficiencies</h1>
<p>I was able to track myself, even while switching to <em>private navigation</em>, with a high rate of success.
(from my own <em>poc</em>, failures were essentially due to errors/imprecisions in my code)</p>
<p>It's like the same DNS cache is shared in major web browsers, <strong>even when private navigation is used</strong>. I'll be happy if someone could confirm/infirm this.</p>
<p>From an advertiser point of view, this could complete a more traditionnal <em>cookie-based</em> approach. </p>
<h1>Possible inefficiencies</h1>
<h2>Cache control</h2>
<p>Due to the recursive nature of the DNS, multiple levels of caching could be an issue.</p>
<h2>Shared cache</h2>
<p>If the cache is shared against many clients, It become hard to track a single user. </p>
<p>This kind of setup is common within entreprise-grade networks.
This could eventually be tricked by using a large number of sudomains, or dynamic subdomains using unique identifiers.</p>
<p>At this point, a large and frequent load of DNS resolutions using high domain entropy could trigger some intrusion detection systems. </p>
<h2>Reaction from vendors</h2>
<p>I don't know the major web-browser positions on this topic.
From my (naive) perspective, Countermeasures could be easily implemented client-side, eg, by ignoring supplied DNS cookies.</p>
<h2>Available Countermeasures</h2>
<p>I don't know any simple trick to avoid this tracking. If it's well implemented, it's pretty efficient.
Once again, if someone has an idea, let me know.</p>
<h1>My point of view</h1>
<p>The traditionnal use of HTTP Cookies for tracking purpose is already somewhat an abuse.</p>
<p>DNS tracking <em>abuses</em> a different level, the DNS Protocol and DNS-Cookies. 
It's similar to a de-anonymisation attack. Cache is abused and logs from two differents protocols (DNS/HTTP) are correlated.</p>
<p>Considering the GDPR, the DNS cookie could be considered as something that permits unique identification. </p>
<p>Anyway, it's hard to believe that the "online advertising world" is trying to help consumers using such ... nasty tricks? </p>
<p>I'd better bet on privacy to regain consumers trust, then try to disrupt how preferences and behavior are used, to offer more control to the end-user and a less invasive approach. But that's way too utopic because ... nobody likes ads?</p>
