*** Welcome

------

Hi! I'm Thomas, a french software engineer. I currently live in Paris.

I like to solve problems involving computers and software, especially those running under Linux.

/Tradelab/ is a programmatic marketing platform, mainly operating in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_bidding][Real Time Biding]] field.

- Hired as a DevOps @Infrastructure & Cloud Services
- Working on /PaaS/ features, software architecture and Linux related issues
- /Docker/, /Jenkins/, /Google Cloud Platform/
- Infrastructure/security oriented missions, in conjuction with various contractors (system administration and network administration)

*** 1000Mercis/Numberly Group (Jan 2016 - Oct 2018)

- Python developer
- Joined a small team (2-5)
- Python and security best practices
- SQL (SQL-Server), mongoDB

/Numberly/ (1000Mercis group) is a marketing agency focused on data collection, /Customer Relationship Management/, /Real Time Biding/ and some others ways to increase digital impact.

This experience was very interesting on various aspects. 
At Numberly, I've discovered how it feels to work with various (/non tech/) profiles, and surprisingly, I've enjoyed it a lot.

Initially hired as a Python Developer, I've mostly worked on a Python HTTP API designed to gather personal data, used in many contexts (Websites, online mini-games, applications...)

I've worked on several topics within this perimeter.
So far, my favourite one was about optimizing legacy Python code heavily used in production. 
After a few but anxiety-prone bugs, we managed to divide the load of a whole cluster by 3, and we were pretty happy about it.

Then, I've increased my perimeter and also had opportunities to help with production system's reliability and information/infrastructure security.

*** OVH (May-Oct 2015)

#+ATTR_HTML: :style float:right
[[file:images/ovh.png]]

/OVH is a French hosting company/

- It was my last internship
- Perl/Python oriented
- I also used AngularJS
- Linux environments


At OVH, I've learned what a "pretty big" infrastructure is, and what it involves to keep it up and running.
Also, handling a lot of services, including legacy ones, at scale is hard - software lifecycle is a real challenge, as well as development itself.

The people there were the most brilliant I've ever met so far, and I've never learned as much in a short window of time.

** Interests


I enjoy programming a lot. 
I have professional experiences with Python (2.7+) and still prefer Python for various personal projects.
The same applies to shell scripting on Linux, but I'm not enjoying that as much as Python :)


I also use /Ansible/, have a daily use of /Git/ and Linux.
I find my accidental and limited knowledge of Linux very useful in a professional context involving Linux boxes. 

On a more personal touch, I enjoy programming in `Rust` in my spare time, and stupid and/or useless projects. See my github for [[https://github.com/slashdevsda/fb/blob/master/main.asm#L104][/non pertinent stuff/]] :')

I'm interested by distributed systems, applications and workloads - like discovering and understanding how a database fits into the CAP theorem, for instance.

This leads me to learn /Elixir/ (and a little bit of /Erlang/ too) with /OTP/ on my spare time - I found these concepts and mechanics very interesting, as well as the functional paradigm.




I also like bonsa√Øs, internet culture, video-games and hacking.
