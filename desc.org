*** Peopledoc / UKG (Jan 2020)




#+ATTR_HTML: :style float:right

/PeopleDoc/ is a company building HRSD software (Human Resource Service Delivery)
\\
\\
\\
\\



- My first full-remote position
- Working on a keystone component of Peopledoc, a somewhat large and complex Python/Django codebase
- Various specialized datastores (PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch, Redis)
- Many components and asynchronous workflows
- Secure and wide environment


I dedicate roughly 50% of my time working around infrastructure topics (contributing to our ansible codebase, incident diagnosis and a few operational tasks), 
spending time with SRE and devops teams to architecture, reproduce bugs and so on.
\\
The challenges are quite interesting: we have to ensure and maintain service availability while delivering (sometimes not so stable) features - each compromise has to be evaluated, a mistake or some misunderstood quickly happen within a large Python codebase and environment.
Partially due to usage, we've hit various Django's limit, especially around Django's /Object Relational Mapper/. Working with /skilled Database Administrators/ surely helps a lot.
\\
\\
Common subjects:
- Feature conception and development (Python 3.6/3.7/3.8 / Django / Jinja)
  in a constrained environment (monthly releases, security, SLA)

- Infrastructure / deployments and automation (Ansible)
- Incident recovery as well as diagnosis & postmortems
- Security compliance, response and high-availability topics

/PeopleDoc/ is now part of UKG (Ultimate Kronos Group)

*** Tradelab (Nov 2018 - Dec 2019)

#+ATTR_HTML: :style float:right
file:images/tradelab.png

/Tradelab/ is a programmatic marketing platform, mainly operating in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_bidding][Real Time Biding]] field.

- Hired as a DevOps @Infrastructure & Cloud Services
- Working on /PaaS/ features, software architecture and Linux related issues
- /Docker/, /Jenkins/, /Google Cloud Platform/
- Infrastructure/security oriented missions, in conjuction with various contractors (system administration and network administration)

---

Hired as a devops, my primary task was to develop, maintain and enhance jenkins' continuous integration pipelines.
The ecosystem was mainly PHP, I helped on migrating various components from PHP5 to PHP7 without any prior knowledge about PHP and from a devops perspective - this was fun.


It took a few months then I started working on infrastructure and security topic.
These were essentially about initiating inventories, as well as redesign / migrate services to increase security and best practices.

The infrastructure was both /bare-metal/ and /Cloud/ (Google Cloud Platform), we used to configure the bare metal one with Ansible and used containers-on-VM a lot on Google Cloud Platform's side.

*** 1000Mercis/Numberly Group (Jan 2016 - Oct 2018)

#+ATTR_HTML: :style float:right
[[file:images/1000mercis.jpg]]

- Python developer
- Joined a small team (2-5)
- Python and security best practices
- SQL (SQL-Server), mongoDB

/Numberly/ (1000Mercis group) is a marketing agency focused on data collection, /Customer Relationship Management/, /Real Time Biding/ and some others ways to increase digital impact.

This experience was very interesting on various aspects. 
At Numberly, I've discovered how it feels to work with various (/non tech/) profiles, and surprisingly, I've enjoyed it a lot.

---

Initially hired as a Python Developer, I've mostly worked on a Python HTTP API designed to gather personal data, used in many contexts (Websites, online mini-games, applications...)

I've worked on several topics within this perimeter.
So far, my favourite one was about optimizing legacy Python code heavily used in production. 
After a few but anxiety-prone bugs, we managed to divide the load of a whole cluster by 3, and we were pretty happy about it.

Then, I've increased my perimeter and also had opportunities to help with production system's reliability and information/infrastructure security.

*** OVH (May-Oct 2015)

#+ATTR_HTML: :style float:right
[[file:images/ovh.png]]

/OVH is a French hosting company/

- It was my last internship
- Perl/Python oriented
- I also used AngularJS
- Linux environments


At OVH, I've learned what a "pretty big" infrastructure is, and what it involves to keep it up and running.
Also, handling a lot of services, including legacy ones, at scale is hard - software lifecycle is a real challenge, as well as development itself.

The people there were the most brilliant I've ever met so far, and I've never learned as much in a short window of time.

** Interests


I enjoy programming a lot. 
I have professional experiences with Python (2.7+) and still prefer Python for various personal projects.
The same applies to shell scripting on Linux, but I'm not enjoying that as much as Python :)


I also use /Ansible/, have a daily use of /Git/ and Linux.
I find my accidental and limited knowledge of Linux very useful in a professional context involving Linux boxes. 

On a more personal touch, I enjoy programming in `Rust` in my spare time, and stupid and/or useless projects. See my github for [[https://github.com/slashdevsda/fb][/non pertinent stuff/]] :')

I'm interested by distributed systems, applications and workloads - like discovering and understanding how a database fits into the CAP theorem, for instance.

This leads me to learn /Elixir/ (and a little bit of /Erlang/ too) with /OTP/ on my spare time - I found these concepts and mechanics very interesting, as well as the functional paradigm.




I also like bonsa√Øs, hydroponics, electronic, Computer-aided design (CAD), 3d printing, internet culture, video-games, computer graphics and hacking around.
